GitHub Repo Demo 

Create a public repo - CU-DotNet-Jan26-B4

Clone it on your laptop 

git clone https://github.com/sharadksingh67/CU-DotNet-Jan26-B4

Create folders for day wise submission like Day5

Put your code or project in this folder

git status

git add .

git commit -m "git demo"

git push -u origin main





















.NET has 2 broad category of types

Value Types and Reference Types

Struct		Classes / Interfaces etc 

Stack		Heap

A Solution can have multiple Project(s) 
A Project can have File(s) (.cs and other files)
A file can have 1 or more classes etc

The Class having Main is called Startup class

BCL is referenced by dependencies

System is most common Namespace
A namespace has unique named class
Every Project will have its own namespace

DO Not use Top Level Statements is selected 
Build Solution - output window - Success
Error - Red Squiggle

Create a project in VS2026 with top level statement

Coding Practices - 
Naming Conventions - 
	Method Name - Pascal case
	Class Name - Pascal case
	Namespace Name - Pascal case
	Main - Pascal case
	args & local variables - Camel case

IDE - many windows

	Solution Explorer
	Properties
	
A window can be floating or Docked

To dock drag and drop to a position holder
We can make a window AutoHide

can enable or disable line numbers in C# editor
Tools - Options - C# - uncheck Line Numbers


Data Types - 

		Value Types 			Ref Types

		struct				Class

		int  alias to Int32 struct	string - String

		In coding we use alias name

		16 bit int Int16 alias short
		64 bit int Int64 alias long


cw is a snippet for Console.WriteLine()

for is also another snippet

Multiple files in a project

Is it possible to run second file code

How to create main in second file

svm - Main snippet

specify startup file - project properties 
	
Can rename file and class whenever required

When we build what happens?
	IL created
Where? Open Project Folder 
	bin - debug 
	obj

Project is targeting .NET 8

Edit Project File - XML file having some configurations

exe is created - MSIL file

.exe .dll


In windows what is .dll - Dynamic Link Library



A project can be an executable project / library project

Library project is to be used by other projects / reusable

Library project will have public classes

Write your first C# code
Store and retrieve data using literal and variable values in C#
Convert data types using casting and conversion techniques in C#
Perform basic operations on numbers in C#


Convert.ToInt32(decimal) does not truncate; 
it performs rounding to the nearest integer using MidpointRounding.ToEven (banker’s rounding).


Create a document providing all steps for
publishing using self contained and dependent mode
 

MVC Model View Controller
Structure of Project
wwwroot - to have static files
Views - folder to contain web output
	in form of razor pages
 MVC supports razor engine

	CS + html  .cshtml

	Will sub folder with the name of
	controllers having multiple razor
	pages for the controller output


Controller folder will have multiple
	controllers to handle request
	and response as per url (Route)

	A controller can handle multiple
	requests 

Controller should be derived from Controller
	class

Controller will have multiple
	action methods and will return	
	action result


Models folder - entity classes
	
appsettings.json

	we can add more settings like
	ConnectionString to database
	in this file


MVC app is web app but starts as a 
	console application

Program.cs -  
	creates a web host
	
	configures multiple services


 	can add more services like 	EntityFramework service


	configures middleware
